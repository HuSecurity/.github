## HuSecurity Computer Science Scholarship Project

## What is It?

HuSecurity is a school scholarship project that connects to a external motion tracking camera. Ideally if the user wants to use their own camera I can put 
the code ontop of their camera feed and the AI will still be able to detect humans. My external motion tracking camera is going to be made on a Raspberry Pi 4
that will display the live feed to a undisclosed link which will then also be displayed on the app. This will also have a playback feature. 

## Planned Components

**AI Detection**
This will be a file/respository of the code used to create a AI motion tracking camera. I'm going to build this code directly into my camera and will then have this streamed 
to a external live feed + my webapp **- Completed Camera, need to upload the python file for AI**

**Backend**
The backend database storing small bits of information. Will be hosted either on a old computer of mine or Google's Firebase (Unsure). **- To-Do (Connected with the WebApp)**

**Webapp**
The main component that pieces everything together. Will hopefully fucntion well and look good while doing it!!  **- To-Do**

**Promotional Website**
Meant to promote website and be a small part of the bigger project. Advertisation and concept of what my project would look like professionally. **- Completed**
